This is a final class project for Machine Learning utilizing Python and SciKitLearn. Through binary classification, multi-class classification, and clustering approaches, the models implemented in this project predict Amazon Review Scores given:

- Verified status of user
- Review time
- Reviewer ID
- Product ID
- Reviewer name
- Review text
- Unix review time
- Number of helpful votes
- Review images
- Product style information

Some more analysis of the different models is provided in the Jupyter Notebook file.
